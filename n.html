        <p>The world is full of mysterious "things," but life keeps on going peacefully because no one can see them--except Misao. Harada Misao has the special power to see these "things," but she doesn't tell anybody and tries to continue leading a happy high school life. Though she's jealous of her friends who have boyfriends, she's just like a normal teenage girl as she keeps having dreams about a boy she met when she was younger who has the same power she does.</p>

        <p>Her mundane life suddenly changes when demons try to eat her, and her old friend Kyo comes back to protect her from them. Then, she finds out that she is personally being sought out by demons either to become their bride or their food, and that Kyo is a demon, too. Will she still marry him like they promised when they were children, based on her faith in him that he has no bad intentions towards her? Will she even be safe at school now that Kyo has become her new homeroom teacher? Her exciting teenage life is just about to begin.</p>
